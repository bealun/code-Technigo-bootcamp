  <h1>Application Programming Interface</h1>
    <p>
      When your birthday is 2nd October you'll get to explain API - Application Programming Interface.
      Not a word you'll hear on a daily basis maybe but it is something you use. A lot, for sure.
      It's purpose is actually very clear - to simplify programming in software application.
      This by providing tools to let software components interact with eachother. In other words it will help
      communicate your requests and return the response back - a very helpful tool for developers. But when do I actually use this, you wonder.
      Well, Klarna payment method is a great example. You'll see the pink Klarna checkout in more or less
      any online shop because it's a simple and efficent payment method. You have reached the checkout and placed
      an order but behind the scenes a lot of things happend that you didn't see. First you'll have to be authorized by
      entering your personal identity number where Klarna gets your national registred address by sending a request, which we know by now.
      The sum of your order is of course handled through the merchants website. But maybe you have a discount or voucher to use? Or free shipping over 50â‚¬?
      That kind of input will also have to be sent and handled.
      Then it will continue to process the transaction between merchant and customer - API enables these processes by communication
      and makes it safe to use by encrypting the data.
      And that's the short story.</p>
      <p>You will get your purchase, the seller will be paid and everyone is happy, right?</p>
